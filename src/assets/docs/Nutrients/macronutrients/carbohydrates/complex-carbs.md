# Complex carbohydrates

Complex carbohydrates are carbohydrates whith complex sugar unit branches. Polysaccharides (read next) are the most predominant type of carbohydrates in the body, 
hence, they are the only group of carbohydrates that bring benefits.
Although complex carbohydrates are not considered essential nutrients, because the body cand provide its necesarry energy supplies from protein and fats, they provide 
additional benefits to the human body.

## Classification
### Starch
- most common complex carbohydrate found in foods.

### Glycogen
- used as energy storage in the liver and muscles.

### Fiber
- improves the overal health of the digestive system, but is not absorbed.

## Absorption
Raw starch is very hard to digest and happens only in the colon, whereas cooked starch is much more easier to digest and to absorb.
Complex carbohydrate dygestion begins in the mouth and continues in the intestine, and requires the alkaline medium, hence, it is not recommended to combine them 
with other nutrients that require or generate an acid medium, like animal protein, fat, and acid fruits. The enzyme ptyalin, that creates the alkaline medium, 
is neutralized in acid medium. Sugars also create an acid medium by generating a large amount of saliva secretion in the mouth.

### Functions
- energy supply;
- intestinal pH balance;
- satiety increase;
- reduce insulin and glucose levels;
- lower LDL ("bad" cholesterol);
- facilitate regular defecation

### Deficiency
- constipation;
- irritable bowel syndrome;
- inflammatory bowel disease;
- ulcerative colitis;
- crohn's disease;
- chronic fatigue;
- cardiovascular disease;
- obesity;
- depression.

### Excess
- weight gain;
- bloating;
- abdominal pain;
- nausea;
- vomiting;
- dry mouth;
- dizziness;
- diarheea;
- difficulty swallowing.

## Food sources
- whole grains;
- potatoes;
- legumes;
- winter squashes;
- pumpkin;
- tofu;
- fruits;
- vegetables.

### Food combining
Do:
- vegetables - protein;
- vegetables - fats;
- vegetables - starch;
- melons - nothing;
- acid fruits - nuts and seeds;
- sweet fruits - nuts and seeds;
- sweet fruits - whole grains;
- whole grains (cooked) - yogurt.

Do not:
- starch - animal protein;
- acid fruits - other carbohydrates;
- acid fruits - animal protein;
