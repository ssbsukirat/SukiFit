# Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are the primary and most common source of energy in the human body. This is because glucose (read next) is the energy supply of all cells in the body. However, glucose can be be obtained only by carbohydrate break-fdown, but also from 
protein and fat synthesis. Thus, carbohydratesa are not essential nutrients for the human body. The cells with the most glucose requirements are those in the central nervous system (e.g. _neurons_) and those that require aerobic glycolysis (e.g. _red blood cells_).

From the chemical point of view, carbohydrates are organic compounds made made of sugar units (saccharides). According to these branches, there are two types of carbohydrates, each of wich are classified in two groups: simple carbohydrates (sugars) and complex carbohydrates.

## Classification
### Simple carbohydrates (sugars)
- Monosaccharides (one sugar unit) - _glucose_, _fructose_, and _galactose_;
- Disaccharides (two sugar units) - _sucrose_, _lactose_, and _maltose_.

### Complex carbohydrates:
- Oligosaccharides (three to ten sugar units);
- Polysaccharides (mored than ten sugar units) - _starch_, _glycogen_, and _fiber_.

### Absorption
Carbohydrate digestion begins in the mouth in the presents of silava and then continues in the intestine. The digestion rate depends upon the sugar branches: 
the more complex the carbs, the more it takes to break down the sugar units, to be converted into glucose, and be absrobed.

Sugars and complex carbohydrates are digested differently, though. Sugars trigger large amounts of saliva, which generates an acid medium. Also, because of 
their simple structure, they are digested and absorbed much faster. On the other hand, complex carbohydrates are digested slowly and require an alkaline medium 
and the enzyme ptyalin to be digested, which is neutralized in acid medium. Thus, combining sugars and complex carbs at the same meal is a bad idea.

Another important fact is the faster glucose enters the bloodstream, the higher the glycemic index, hence simple carbohydrates have high glycemic  index, whereas, complex carbs have lower glycemic index.
Glucose in the blood is regulated by insulin, which acts like a "gate-keeper" for cells to absorb the necesarry fuel from the blood. It also opens the "gates" 
for glucose to be absrobed by adypocites (fat cells) when present in large amounts in the blood. Thus, excess glucose at once, leads to high amounts of insulin release, which leads to fat storage, weight gain, and long term-health problems: type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, pancreas damage, and more.
