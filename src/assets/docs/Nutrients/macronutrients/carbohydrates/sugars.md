# Sugars

Sugars are simples carbohydrates with no more than two sugar units. As a rule of a thumb, every nutrient that ends with "-oze" is a sugar.
The majority of sugars found in food are not natural (e.g. fructose, lactose, and maltose), but are synthetic ("added sugars" or sweeteners). They are most commonly found in processed food, for food preservation.
Because the body is able to synthesize glucose from protein and fats, sugars are essential nutrients for the human organism.

## Classification
### Monoscacharides
- glucose;
- fructose;
- galactose.

### Discacharides
- sucrose;
- lactose;
- maltose.

## Absorption
Sugar digestion begins in the mouth in the presence of saliva and ends in the intestine, where they are absorbed immediately. They balso create an acid medium, hence, it is recommended to not be 
combined with any other nutrient.

The biggest problem with sugarsis they are absorbed very fast, because of their simple structure, which causes a high glucose levels (glicemic index) at once.
Glucose is regulated by insulin, which acts like a "gate-keeper" for cells to absorb the necesarry fuel from the blood. It also opens the "gates" 
for glucose to be absrobed by adypocites (fat cells) when present in large amounts in the blood. Thus, excess glucose at once, leads to high amounts of insulin release, which leads to fat storage, weight gain, and long term-health problems: type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, pancreas damage, and more.

### Functions
- energy supply.

### Deficiency
Sugars don't have deficienc effects.

### Excess
- heart disease;
- type II diabetes;
- high blood pressure (hypertension);
- obesity;
- alzheimer's disease;
- addiction;
- hyperactivity;
- tooth decay;
- osteoporosis;
- depression.

## Food sources
- _fruit_, _milk_, _desserts_, _syrups_, _soft drinks_, _cookies_, _candy_, and _processed foods_.

### Food combining
Sugars shouldn't be combined with any food.

### Average recommended intake
- 5% of your daily energy intakes (25g/day for 2000kcal/day).
