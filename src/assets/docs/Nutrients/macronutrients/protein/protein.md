# Protein
Protein is the major structural component in every single cell in the body: blood cells, skin cells, enzymes, membranes, transport carries, muscle fibers, everything is made of protein and every process 
in the body requires protein. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein and act as precursors for nucleic acids, chemical messengers, hormones, neurotransmitters, and other important molecules.
Protein quality varies according to its essential amino acid content. Proteins that contain all 9 essential amino acids are called complete proteins.
## Classification
### Essential amino acids
- [Histidine](histidine.md)
- [Isoleucine](isoleucine.md)
- [Leucine](leucine.md)
- [Lysine](lysine.md)
- [Methionine](methionine.md)
- [Phenylalanine](phenilalanine.md)
- [Threonine](threonine.md)
- [Tryptophan](tryptophan.md)
- [Valine](valine.md).

### Non-essential amino acids
- Alanine
- Arginine
- Asparagine
- Aspartic acid
- Cysteine
- Glutamic acid
- Glutamine
- Glycine
- Proline
- Serine
- Tyrosin

## Absorption
Proteins are denaturated by stomach acid and afterwards are hydrolyzed by enzymes in the intestine. Amino acids require Vitamin B6 and Vitamin C 
for metabolism. Also, amino acid are required by all metabolic processes in the human body.
