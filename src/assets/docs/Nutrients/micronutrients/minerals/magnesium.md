# Magnesium
Magnesium is an essential mineral element. Its main function is as coenzyme and bone development.

## Absorption
Only 50% of the magnesium intake is absorbed.
Magnesium absorption requires: vitamin D.
Magnesium absorption is impaired by: excess calcium, high protein, phytic acid, fiber, phosphorus, alcohol, diuretic, high cholesterol, and corticosteroid drugs.

## Functions
coenzyme found in several enzymes
	• Creates and Maintains Bone Integrity
	• Enables Energy Production
	• Maintains Nervous System Balance
	• Enhances Control of Inflammation
Enhances Control of Blood Sugar
processing ATP and for bones
Activates enzymes responsible for catalytic reactions between phosphate ions and adenosine triphosphate. Controls body temperature, prevents calcification of soft tissue, and synthesizes proteins. Assists in calcium and potassium uptake. Activates enzymes necessary for the metabolism of carbohydrates and amino acids, helps to regulate acid/alkaline balance in the body, bone growth, teeth enamel, used for proper function of nerves, memory, muscles, liver and glands.

## Deficiency
 cardiovascular problems, confusion, insomnia, irritability, rapid heartbeat, seizures or tetany, depression, tremors, muscle twitch, convulsions, kidney stones, tooth decay, exhaustion and soft bones.

## Excess
•Diarrhea (primary symptom) •Nausea •Abdominal cramps •Metabolic alkalosis •Hypokalemia •Paralytic ileus

## Disease preventions
	• Coronary artery disease
	• Arrhythmia
	• Mitral valve prolapse
	• Congestive heart failure
	• Hypertension
	• Diabetes
	• Osteoporosis
	• Muscle cramping
	• Chronic fatigue
	• Depression
	• Anxiety
	• Asthma
	• COPD / Emphysema
Fatty liver disease (NASH)

## Food sources
nuts, seeds, fatty fish, cacao, whole grains foods, and in green leafy vegetables.

## Average recommended intake
- 320mg/day.
