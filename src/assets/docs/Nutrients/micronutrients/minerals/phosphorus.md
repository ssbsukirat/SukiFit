# Phosphorus
Phosphorus (P) is an essential mimeral element. Its main function is to maintain normal pH levels and as component in bones.

## Absorption
70% of phosphorus is absorbed.
85% of phosporus is accumulated in the skeleton.
Phosphorus absorption requires: yeasts.
Phosphorus absorption is impaired by: calcium, magnesium, aluminium, antacids, alcohol, aspirin, corticosteroid drugs and diuretics

## Functions
components of bones, teeth, phospholipids, ATP, and nucleic acids.
	• Enable Basic Cell Function
	• Energy Production
	• Macronutrient metabolism
Regulation of acid-base homeostasis
 building of bones and teeth, repair of cells, growth maintenance, teeth and bones, skeletal growth, carbohydrates, kidney functioning, fat, protein metabolism, muscle contractions and nerve activity.

## Deficiency
Anorexia •Anemia •Muscle weakness •Bone pain •Rickets (in children) and osteomalacia (in adults) •General debility
Increased susceptibility to infection •Paresthesias •Ataxia • Confusion •Possible death
- bone diseases and weakness, gum and tooth diseases, nervous disorders, under or overweight, stunted growth, and irregular bleeding. 

## Excess
hyperphosphatemia
- impaired absorption of calcium.
- kidney stones;

## Disease preventions
	• Kidney disease
	• Cardiovascular prevention
Osteoporosis risk
