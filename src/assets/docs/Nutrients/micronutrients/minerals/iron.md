# Iron
Iron (Fe) is an essential trace element. Its main function is as component of several proteins, including enzymes, cytochromes, myoglobin, and hemoglobin

## Absorption
66% of the absorbed iron is accumulated in hemoglobin on blood cells.

Iron absorption requires:
- vitamin A;
- vitamin B12, copper, vitamin C, animal protein, 
Iron absorption is impaired by: calcium, zinc, phytic acid, Polyphenols, vegetable protein, phosphorus, alcohol, coffee, tea, bleeding, diarrhea, stress, lack of hydrochloric acid, antacids, and aspirins.

## Functions
composition of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and certain enzymes.
	• Enhances Oxygen Transport
Supports Energy Production
hemoglobin, myoglobin formation, aids in tissue respiration as well as cellular oxygenation. Aids nutrition of epithelial tissues. Needed for proper assimilation of B Vitamins, increases resistance to stress and disease.

## Deficiency
fatigue, pale skin, irritability, general malaise, difficulty swallowing, weakness, brittle nails, general lethargy, constipation iron-deficiency, and breathing difficulty

## Excess
- impaired vitamin A absorption;
bloody diarrhea, heart irregularities, weakness, and shortness of breath
constipation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
cardiovascular, central nervous system, kidney, liver, and hematological effects

## Disease preventions
	• Anemia
	• Fatigue
	• Excessive menstrual flow (menorrhagia)
	• Pregnancy / lactation
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
