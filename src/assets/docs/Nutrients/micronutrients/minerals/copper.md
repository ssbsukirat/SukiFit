# Copper
Copper (Cu) is an essential trace element. Its main function is as component of redox enzymes (oxidases in the reduction of molecular oxygen).

## Absorption
Around 50% of copper intake is absrbed. The absorption decreases proportionally to the intake increase. After absorption, 66% is accumulated in the skeleton and muscles. The liver is the one that maintains normal plasma copper levels.
Copper absorption requires:.
Copper absorption is impaired by: vitamin C, zinc, iron, molybdenum.

## Functions
	• Antioxidant Protection
	• Bone and Tissue Integrity
	• Energy Support
	• Cholesterol Balance
Iron absorption
synthesis of hemoglobin and red blood cells. Needed for integrity of joints and nerves. Necessary for formation of elastin. Aids with production of enzymes needed for respiration, protein metabolism, healing process, hair and skin pigment, oxidation of Vitamin C and iron absorption. 

## Deficiency
general weakness, impaired respiration, lower collagen and lower white blood cell formation, retarded growth, skin ores, pernicious anemia, and respiratory problems.

## Excess
 abdominal pain, cramps, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.


## Disease preventions
	• Anemia
	• High blood cholesterol
	• Fatigue
	• Low immune function
	• Osteoporosis
	• Wound healing
	• Cardiac arrhythmia
Arthritis
