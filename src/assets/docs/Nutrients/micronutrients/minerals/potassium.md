Potassium absorption is impaired by: sodium, diuretics, caffeine, stress, diarrhea, alcohol, high cholesterol, aspirin, sugar, and corticosteroid drugs.

## Functions
muscle and nerve function, and also is a major component of intracellular fluid.
	• Hormone secretion and action
	• Vascular tone
	• Maintaining Normal Blood Pressure
	• Gastrointestinal motility
	• Acid–base homeostasis
	• Glucose and insulin metabolism
	• Mineralocorticoid action
	• Kidney Health
Fluid and electrolyte balance
electrolyte responsible for aced/base balance. Promotes regular heartbeat, normal muscle contraction, regulates water balance, essential for proper muscle function, helps regulate water/fluid balance, stimulates kidney to remove body waste, cell metabolism, heart rhythm, growth, protein and glucose absorption.

## Deficiency
hypokalemia, vomiting, perspiration, severe cardiac problems, nervous disorders, insomnia, and general weakness.

## Excess
irregular heartbeat, partial paralysis, coma and convulsions. Gastrointestinal discomfort 

## Disease preventions
