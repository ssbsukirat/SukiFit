# Nutrients

Nutrients are components that are required by living organisms in order to survive and evolve. They can be synthesized by the body - _non-essential_ - or 
they must be obtained through nutrition - _essential_. These are:
- [Water](macronutrients/water.md)
- Oxygen
- [Essential fatty acids](macronutrients/fats/fats.md)
- [Essential amino acids](macronutrients/protein/protein.md)
- [Vitamins](micronutrients/vitamins/vitamins.md)
- [Minerals](micronutrients/minerals/minerals.md)

According to the required amounts, nutrients are classified in: macronutrients, required in large amounts, because they provide the energy - "fuel" - to sustain the metabolic processes, and micronutrients, 
the "factory workers" in the metabolic and body processes. They also build and repair tissues.

The major nutrient groups are: _carbohydrates_, _fats_, _protein (amino acids)_, _vitamins_, _minerals_, _water_, and _oxygen_.

## Classification
### Macronutrients
- [Carbohydrates](macronutrients/carbohydrates/carbohydrates.md)
- [Lipids (Fatty acids)](macronutrients/fats/fats.md)
- [Protein (Amino acids)](macronutrients/protein/protein.md)

### Micronutrients
- [Vitamins](micronutrients/vitamins/vitamins.md)
- [Minerals](micronutrients/minerals/minerals.md)

Note: Although water and oxygen are required in large amounts and contirbute to all metabolic processes, they are not considered macronutrients, because they are not converted into energy.

### Be careful with:
- `Alcohol`
- `Cholesterol`
- `Saturated fat`
- `Sodium`
- `Sugars`
- `Trans fat`

These nutrients cause serious health problems when taken in excess. Limit them as much as you can.

We need to develop the mindset that food is building block for our body. What we eat is what we are and what we are 
is what we need to eat. We need to offer the body exactly what it needs and how much it needs. Any abuse, of any sort 
is unhealthy. The body has advanced mechanisms of managing excess nutrients by either storing them in form of 
fat and glycogen, either eliminating them through urine, perspiration, and breathing. 

Thus, essential nutrient must be provided from natural organic food sources and not from synthetic suplements. 
The symptoms of excess intakes from all nutrients can occur only by taking supplements, never ever from natural sources.
